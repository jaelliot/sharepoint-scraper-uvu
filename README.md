# SharePoint Scraper for UVU

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script designed to scrape data from a SharePoint site at Utah Valley University. The project was not completed due to the decision not to bypass the school's security measures.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Git
- Linux

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaelliot/sharepoint-scraper-uvu.git
```
2. **Navigate into the Directory**
```bash
cd sharepoint-scraper-uvu
```
3. **Install Required Python Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Setup Configuration File**
Create a .env file in the project directory and populate it with your SharePoint credentials:
```bash
SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL=https://uvu365.sharepoint.com/sites/GameCreation
SHAREPOINT_USER=1234567898765@uvu.edu
SHAREPOINT_PASSWORD=1234567890-98765432121
```

## Running the Script

Execute the script using Python:
```bash
python3 sharepoint-scraper.py
```

## Project Status
This project was discontinued due to not wanting to get kicked out of school and/or arrested; getting this script to be functional and actually scrape UVU's sharepoint will be detected, it will get you kicked out, and possible arrested. I strongly advise against modifying this script to work around the Azure ACL.

## Support
Nah, I'm not interested in getting in trouble. You're free to wreck your own life.
